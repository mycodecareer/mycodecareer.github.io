My Code Career was started to share my experience changing careers. Leaving
my old career and becoming a software developer was one of the best decisions
of my life. Through My Code Career I want to help others with their journey
to becoming a software developer, or those looking to learn new skills.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
