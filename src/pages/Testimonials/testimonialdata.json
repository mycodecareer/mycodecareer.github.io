    "testimonialText": "Before joining the program, I was not getting many responses to my applications. But after tweaking my CV with Matthew's guidance, I started getting a consistent influx of opportunities related to my field. The program also taught me how to read job descriptions in-depth and tailor my responses to match their requirements. Matthew provided valuable company-specific feedback that really helped me navigate the application process. I truly appreciate all the help and support I've received, and I feel like I have a clear path forward now.",

    "testimonialText": "Clearly, the biggest barrier I was encountering when we first met was where to begin. I felt like I was throwing a dart at a board, blindfolded. But you've definitely pointed me in the right direction, and I now have a better understanding of where I stand. I've overcome that barrier and feel a lot better at this point. The most helpful part of our time together was the glue you provided for my software development journey. You helped with providing the human user interface between technology and where I was, including asking better questions and understanding my why. You've drawn that out of me and many of your other students, and I now have a more robust slice of knowledge to move forward with. I'm most proud of the accomplishment of finding the direction I needed to focus on, which was golden for me. Without that, I'd still be lost and taking tutorials for years, wasting my time. I'm grateful for your guidance and looking forward to staying in touch and continuing our journeys towards success.",
